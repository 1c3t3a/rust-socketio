# Introduction

Contributions to this project are welcome! When contributing please follow the
guidelines below.

- When interacting with others, please follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- When you make a commit, please follow the [conventional commits 1.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard.
    - This makes it easier for us to use tools like [jilu](https://crates.io/crates/jilu) to create change logs.
    - Read [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) for more information.

This project is still being developed, albeit at a slow pace.  The goal is to
have a well-designed, well thought out project that could eventually be included
in the rust standard or core libraries, so when you make a contribution, please
think in those terms.  That is:

- For code:
    - Is the contribution in the scope of this crate?
    - Is it well documented?
    - Is it well tested?
- For documentation:
    - Is it clear and well-written?
    - Can others understand it easily?
- For bugs:
    - Does it test functionality of this crate?
    - Do you have a minimal crate that causes the issue that we can use and test?
- For feature requests:
    - Is the request within the scope of this crate?
    - Is the request *clearly* explained such that anyone who reads it can
      *unambiguously* determine what you want done?  **THIS IS IMPORTANT, AND IS
      THE REASON WHY MANY FEATURE REQUESTS ON MANY PROJECTS ARE IGNORED!**
